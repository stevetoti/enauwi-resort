## About Us

Tucked along a quiet stretch of Malekula's South West Bay, E'Nauwi Beach Resort is where warm sand, calm lagoon waters, and genuine Melanesian hospitality come together.

Ideal for families, couples, and groups seeking comfort, good food, and genuine island hospitality.

### Guest Experience
Spend mornings floating in a lagoon so still it mirrors the sky. Cool off in the pool beneath swaying coconut palms. Paddle a kayak to the private island for an afternoon of snorkelling. Then settle into the restaurant as the sun dips behind the islands and the aroma of freshly grilled seafood fills the evening air. Whether it's a family holiday, a romantic escape, or a group getaway, E'Nauwi wraps every guest in the kind of warmth you only find on a Melanesian island.

### 2. 2BR Superior Bungalow (Garden)
Tucked just behind the beachfront row, this two-bedroom retreat is wrapped in the colour and fragrance of Vanuatu's tropical gardens — flowering hibiscus, local mango and papaya trees, and the soft sound of the ocean filtering through the leaves.

For couples and solo travellers who want the lagoon all to themselves. This intimate one-bedroom bungalow opens directly onto the beachfront with sweeping views across the water to the outer islands.
